            Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device. Most, but not all, cybercrime is committed 
            by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. Cybercrime is carried out by individuals or organizations.Some cybercriminals are organized, use 
            advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers. <br><br>
            Here are some specific examples of the different types of cybercrime:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li> Email and internet fraud </li>
                <br>
                <li>Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Theft of financial or card payment data.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Theft and sale of corporate data.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Ransomware attacks (a type of cyberextortion).</li><br>
                <li>Cryptojacking (where hackers mine cryptocurrency using resources they do not own).</li><br>
                <li>Cyberespionage (where hackers access government or company data).</li><br>
            </ul>
            <br>

                Now we need some protection from all these activities. For this we have the concept of Cyber Security.

    <div id="what_is_cs">
        Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
        It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile 
        computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its
                designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a 
                network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</li>

            <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss 
                of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating 
                capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.</li>
            <br>
            <li>End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure 
                system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and 
                various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</li>
        </ul>

                <li>
                    1. Update your software and operating system:This means you benefit from the latest security patches.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    2. Use anti-virus software:Security solutions like Kaspersky Total Security will detect and removes threats. Keep your <br>
                    software updated for the best level of protection.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    3. Use strong passwords: Ensure your passwords are not easily guessable.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    4. Do not open email attachments from unknown senders: These could be infected with malware.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    5. Do not click on links in emails from unknown senders or unfamiliar websites:This is a common way that malware is spread.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    6. Avoid using unsecure WiFi networks in public places:Unsecure networks leave you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
                </li>
